# Java-Book-Indexer
a program in Java which will read the pages of a book and create an index of words giving the list of pages on which each word is present.
The program uses the readExcludeWords method to read the common words from the exclude-words.txt file and store them in a set. It then uses the buildIndex method to read the pages from the specified files, split them into words, and exclude the common words. For each non-excluded word, it adds the page number to a set associated with the word in a map. Finally, the program uses the writeIndex method to write the word index to a file in the specified format. The words are sorted in alphabetical order before writing them to the file.
